                <h3>I like learning,this is the best way to build yourself.</h3>
               
                <p>As a child I was very interested in different kind of games,
              computer and other technologies.When I was in school,I really enjoyed the time
              we were doing  projects using different programs.From that time I was growing
              inside me a little bit of passion for programming.By the time my mind was full of
              different questions about this,and here I began my journey learning programming languages
               and answering my questions.</p>
               
            
               <h3>They Joy Of Traveling</h3>
           
               <p> One of the reasons I love to travel is discovery. That’s because a trip can help you 
                   learn about the world around you – and about yourself as well. 
                 Another reason is that it helps open my mind. I realize that there’s no
                  one way to live life. Meeting people 
                 from other places will show you that your world view isn’t the same as everyone else’s.
               I love traveling, this makes me really happy and i am very excited to expore all over the world</p>
